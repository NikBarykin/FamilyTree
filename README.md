# FamilyTree
In this project you can find useful functionality to work with family trees!
Family tree is a DAG (directed acyclic graph) where every node has unique id and N or 0 parents.
tree.h contains classes Tree and Node which correspond to family tree and its node respectively.
Family trees can be merged, rendered to svg documents for visualisation and provide interesting information about their nodes 
(for example, lowest common ancestors for given pair of nodes).
Also, you can find simple text-based user interface and unit-tests.
